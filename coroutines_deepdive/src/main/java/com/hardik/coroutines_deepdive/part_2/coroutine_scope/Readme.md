#### Using coroutineScope

Imagine that in some repository function you need to asynchronously load two resources, for example user data and a list of articles. In this case, you want to return only those articles that should be seen by the user. To call async, we need a scope, but we donâ€™t want to pass it to a function24. To create a scope out of a suspending function, we use the coroutineScope function.

```
suspend fun getArticlesForUser( userToken: String?,
): List<ArticleJson> = coroutineScope {
    val articles = async { articleRepository.getArticles() } 
    val user = userService.getUser(userToken) articles.await()
       .filter { canSeeOnList(user, it) }
       .map { toArticleJson(it) }
}
```

> coroutineScope is just a suspending function that creates a scope for its lambda expression. The function returns whatever is returned by the lambda expression (like let, run, use, or runBlocking). So, in the above example, it returns List<ArticleJson> because this is what is returned from the lambda expression.
coroutineScope is a standard function we use when we need a scope inside a suspending function.
